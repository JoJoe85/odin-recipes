            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
            <li>1 red chilli, chopped</li>
            <li>75g pitted olives, sliced</li>
            <li>50g capers, drained</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>70g tin double concentrated tomato purée</li>
            <li>400g pasta (of your choice)</li>
            <li>158g tin of drained and flaked tuna</li>
            <li>100g grated mozzarella</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>



        </ul>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a glug of olive oil in a sauté pan or large deep frying pan  and fry the sliced garlic cloves and chopped red chilli over a low-medium heat for 2 minutes. Stir in the olives, capers, tinned tomatoes, half a  tin of water and tomato purée. Season with black pepper and a little salt, bring to the boil,  then simmer over a medium heat for 15 minutes. Heat the oven  to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the  pack instructions in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until  al dente (cooked but with a little bite). Drain, reserving a cup  of cooking liquid, then stir into the tomato sauce along with  the tin of drained and flaked tuna and a little  of the cooking liquid to coat the pasta.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into a 1.2 litre ovenproof baking dish and scatter over the grated mozzarella. Bake for 20 minutes until piping hot and the topping is golden. Serve the pasta bake scattered with fresh basil leaves and a side salad, if you like.</li>
